            text: `Hello, I’m Valentyn. It’s really hard to pronounce, so you can use Val, Valentin or Valek. My current place of living is Wroclaw, but my home city - Kharkiv, Ukraine.
                    I’m a straight open person. Really goal focused. Have a strong experience in front end development and programming itself. I have started my career as a back-end developer,
                     and some time ago moved to a front-end, because was charmed by flexibility and transparency of the JavaScript. But you always have to pay. In this case currency is time 
                     for self-education. So am I. But the time spent on learning for being up to date really worth it. I like playing football, rock climbing, computer gaming.This is my CV.
                      Hope you enjoy!`
